In this lesson, we will explore the practical applications of string operations and type conversions in JavaScript. 
These concepts are crucial and are used in many programming areas. We'll examine a real-world example: time parsing. 
Have you ever wondered how to add a certain number of seconds to a specific time? By the end of today's session, 
you'll be equipped to calculate this using JavaScript. Let's get started!

Task Statement and Description

Imagine this: You receive a time formatted as a string in HH:MM:SS,
where HH, MM, and SS denote the hour, minute, and second, respectively. 
You are also given an integer representing a certain number of seconds. 
Your task is to calculate the new time after adding the provided seconds, 
then output the result in the HH:MM:SS format.

For example, if the input time is 05:10:30 and the number of seconds to 
add is 123, the output should be 05:12:33 since 123 seconds translate to 
2 minutes and 3 seconds.

Please note these points when resolving this task:

The input time is always a valid time string in the HH:MM:SS format,
with HH ranging from 00 to 23 and MM and SS ranging from 00 to 59.
The output should be a time in the same format.
Now let's go ahead and break down how to achieve this in our step-by-step 
solution guide.
