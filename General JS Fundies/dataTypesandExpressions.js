Overview
Greetings! Today, we're about to start an exciting journey into the world of JavaScript. We'll focus on JavaScript fundamentals - printing, comments, data types, and expressions. Imagine you can make a website play a game with its visitors or react to their actions like a fellow human. That's what JavaScript does! Ready to dive in? Let's start.

Dive into JavaScript

JavaScript brings static web pages to life by making them interactive! 

Every language has syntax — rules about how sentences 
(or in our case, statements) should be written. JavaScript is no exception. 
Let's have a quick look:
*/

// Outputting text to the console
console.log("Hello, World!");

/*
In the above example, we're giving a shoutout to the world: "Hello, World!". Remember to always end each statement with a semi-colon (;).

A great start, isn't it? Let's keep going.

Commenting in JavaScript
Coding isn’t just for computers. You also leave notes for fellow humans — future developers or even your future self — known as 'comments'. A comment can either be a one-liner that uses //, or a note stretching across multiple lines within /* and */
// . These comments explain your code’s purpose, design, and functioning, making reading code much easier.
