# codeSignalPractice

a place to keep my notes and practice exercises from the codeSignal course track: 

Fundamental Coding Interview Preparation with JavaScript

I am embarking on this course in preparation for a codeSignal code challenge for the Pinterest Software Engineering Apprenticeship. 
No matter what happense with the code challenge, I am glad to have a structured way to review and get back into coding!
